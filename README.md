##  Project Overview

In stock trading, identifying the best time to buy and sell is crucial.  
This project models stock price fluctuations as a **maximum subarray sum problem**, where:

- Daily price differences represent profit/loss
- Kadane’s Algorithm efficiently finds the most profitable continuous window

The result is a fast and optimal stock profit analyzer.
